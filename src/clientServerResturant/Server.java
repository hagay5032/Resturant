/**
 * This class is for creating a server that will listen to many clients.
 * Any clients that connect to the server need that the first line of his packet
 * will be one of the two options - 
 * 1) "GET_MENU"- it tells the server to send the menu back to the client.
 * 2) "SEND_ORDER"- it tells the server that the client is going to send an 
 * order. Each client is managed by a different thread- and hence this server 
 * can listening to multiple clients.
