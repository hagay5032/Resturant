# Resturant-Client-Server
This is an eclipse java project for running a resturant server that holds the menu, And clients that can order from the server.

This is a one of my university tasks projects, And I share it with pleasure, Hopping to here thoughts and getting notes for 
improving design and code.

The configurations files are for the PORT and IP parameters for the client and server respectively.

This application run with jdk 13, so make sure you install it first.

The formate for the menu file is 5 rows in sequence for each dish:
1. In the first line there will be # symbol.
2. In the second line there will be the code of the dish.
3. In the third line there will be the name of the dish.
4. In the fourth line there will be the description of the dish.
5. In the fifth line there will be the price of the dish.

For example: see the 'menu' file.
